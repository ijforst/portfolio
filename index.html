This academic year, I juggled the responsibilities of three different honor societies, served as the president of University Housing's student governance organization, collectively representing 10,000 campus residents before University administration, worked as an project management intern at an engineering firm, and worked as a Google Season of Docs fellow, all while maintaining a course-load of 15 credit hours.<br>
